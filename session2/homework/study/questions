    Flowchart picure can be found in the PNG file named flowcháº¡t.PNG

3.	What is nested conditionals? Write a piece of code that uses nested conditionals

    We call it nested conditionals when a conditional is used or contained within another.
    
    e.g.

    n = int(input("Insert your handsome score (out of 10)"))
        
    if n > 8.5:
        print("easily get girl friend")

    else:
        if n > 6:
            print("better hit the gym")
        else:
            print("try hard, try very hard, or hit the face surgery real hard")
            print()
            print("just kidding, you're a 10 anyways <3")
